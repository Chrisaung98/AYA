Since our inception, CSR has been an inherent element ingrained in our organizational culture, reflecting our commitment to making a positive impact.
												</p>
												<p>
													Through community engagement, we empower individuals and communities to take an active role in their own well-being and contribute to decisions that shape community development. We collaborate with local educational institutions, offering financial assistance, continuous learning programs, and flexible working arrangements to support the education and growth of the younger generation.
												</p>
												<p>
													In the healthcare sector, we work closely with local hospitals, dispensaries, and civil society organizations, regardless of their status, to provide vital healthcare services to the public. Our philanthropic initiatives encompass various areas of need, amplifying our dedication to creating a positive change in society.

												</p>
												<p>
													Our CSR activities are predominantly implemented directly or through the Ayeyarwady Foundation, ensuring impactful interventions that address the community's needs. During the challenging times of the COVID-19 pandemic, AYA Bank and the Ayeyarwady Foundation took decisive action to combat its impact. Notably, we set up a temporary COVID-Care Hospital with a capacity of over 500 beds and 100 medical staff and volunteers in Thuwanna, Yangon, to provide care for coronavirus-infected patients.
												</p>
												<p>
													Throughout our CSR journey, we have engaged in socio-economic development activities across sectors such as education, health, environment, disaster response, and microfinance, contributing to the well-being of the community we proudly serve.
