									<p>For decades, AYA Bank establishes a deed of trust with our creditors such as deposit holders, businesses, and other parties in the protection of creditor’s right. We secure creditors to enjoy the right to repayment of money by the Bank. Our strong creditor’s right deals not only with the right of creditors against the debtor, but also the potential for the higher growth. Under the debtor and creditor relationship, positioning of each creditor to others is clearly stated and secured creditors are first in line, in case the Bank goes into liquidation. Deposit holders and other creditors are given priority to get back their money, the Bank owed to them. We honor and comply with the Myanmar Financial Institution Law (2016) with respect to ‘Creditor’s Right’ in following:</p>
									<p>
										Clearly spell out, at the time of establishing a client relationship, the liability for losses, as well as the rights and responsibilities of all parties, in the event of products not performing as per specifications or things going wrong. However, the bank will not be liable for any losses caused by extraneous circumstances that are beyond its reasonable control (such as market changes, performance of the product due to market variables, etc.).
										<ul style="list-style: disc;">
											<li>Ensure the client is refunded without delay and demur, if the bank cannot show client liability beyond reasonable doubt on any disputed transaction (along with interest/charges)</li>
											<li>To make payment in full of any claim by a depositor or other creditor in winding up or voluntary liquidation of the Bank;</li>
											<li>To pay all lawful claims promptly and return all funds or other property held by the Bank to rightful owners within such maximum period as the Central Bank of Myanmar may determine</li>
										</ul>
